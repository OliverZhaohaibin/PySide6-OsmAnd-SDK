## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and prepare Git LFS data

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

The bundled `World_basemap_2.obf` demo map is stored through Git LFS. If the file is only about 100 bytes and starts with `version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1`, it is still a pointer file and must be pulled with Git LFS before the preview can render real map data.

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

### 3. Build the native runtime

#### Windows

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\osmand_render_helper_native\build_helper.ps1
```

or build the native widget with MSVC:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\osmand_render_helper_native\build_native_widget_msvc.ps1
```

#### Linux

```bash
bash tools/osmand_render_helper_native/build_linux.sh
```

#### macOS

```bash
QT_ROOT=/opt/homebrew/opt/qt JOBS=4 bash tools/osmand_render_helper_native/build_macos.sh
```

### 4. Launch the preview

```bash
osmand-preview --backend auto
```

You can also run the entry point directly:

```bash
python -m maps.main --backend auto
```

## 🌟 Overview

**PySide6-OsmAnd-SDK** is an independent GitHub project for embedding OsmAnd's native map stack into modern Qt6 and PySide6 workflows.

It combines vendored OsmAnd core sources, native build tooling, Python integration, a Qt widget bridge, and a runnable preview application in one repository. The goal is to make offline map rendering easier to build, test, and embed from a single codebase.

Key highlights:

- 🧭 Ports the OsmAnd Qt5-era native map stack to Qt6.
- 🧩 Exposes a native C++ map widget for PySide6 applications.
- 🗺️ Supports offline rendering from OsmAnd `.obf` map data.
- ⚡ Provides both native OpenGL preview and Python-driven raster preview paths.
- 🛠 Ships build scripts for Windows, Linux, and macOS toolchains.
- 📦 Bundles demo map data and OsmAnd resources for local testing.

---

## 🧭 Why This Project Matters

This SDK is designed for developers who want OsmAnd's offline map engine while building with current-generation Qt and Python tooling. It reduces the friction of combining native C++ rendering with a PySide6 user interface, making it a practical foundation for desktop map viewers, GIS tools, travel applications, embedded map previews, and other offline-first location products.

By moving the native stack forward to Qt6 and validating PySide6 compatibility, the project helps OsmAnd-based development stay usable outside older Qt5-only integration paths.

| --- | --- |
| Native widget hosting | Embed the OsmAnd native widget through PySide6 using `.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib` runtimes. |
| Offline `.obf` rendering | Render OsmAnd binary map packages locally without depending on online map tiles. |
| Python raster path | Use helper-backed Python rendering for preview and integration workflows. |
| OpenGL preview | Test native OpenGL rendering paths through the included preview application. |
| Cross-platform builds | Build helper and widget outputs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. |
| Demo data included | Use the bundled `World_basemap_2.obf` and OsmAnd resources for local validation. |

---

## 🧱 Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `vendor/osmand/build` | Build tree and supporting files used by the Windows-oriented OsmAnd build flow. |

## 🗺 Map Data and Styles

### `.obf` files

OsmAnd `.obf` files are offline binary map packages. They store the geographic content consumed by the native engine, including roads, boundaries, land use, water, place labels, routing-related data, and points of interest.

This repository's preview defaults to:

```text
src/maps/tiles/World_basemap_2.obf
```

The bundled `.obf` is only a default demo dataset. You can replace it with another OsmAnd `.obf` file, select a different file from the preview window, or point the runtime to a custom path through the documented environment variables.

Additional `.obf` map downloads are available from the official OsmAnd download list:

```text
https://download.osmand.net/list.php
```

When a local `plugin/data/geonames.sqlite3` GeoNames index is present, the preview search demo prefers it for place-name lookup and uses the active `.obf` search path as a fallback. The optimized database is compatible with the `GeoNames-search` project output, uses the compact `cities500`-based schema, and keeps global place-name queries such as `北京` / `Beijing` responsive without scanning the full database in Python.

### Rendering styles

Rendering styles are XML-based rule files under:

```text
vendor/osmand/resources/rendering_styles
```

Common examples include:

- `default.render.xml`
- `mapnik.render.xml`
- `snowmobile.render.xml`

These files control how the same `.obf` data appears on screen: colors, line rules, polygon fills, icons, labels, and theme-specific display logic. The Python integration layer passes both the selected `.obf` data source and active style file into the OsmAnd rendering backend, allowing the map presentation to change without changing the underlying geographic data.

## 🧰 Platform Setup

### Windows

```powershell
python -m pip install -e .
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\osmand_render_helper_native\build_helper.ps1
osmand-preview --backend auto
```

Alternative native widget build:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\osmand_render_helper_native\build_native_widget_msvc.ps1
```

Direct entry point:

```powershell
python src\maps\main.py --backend auto
```

### Linux

Install system dependencies first:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git qt6-base-dev libqt6opengl6-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install gcc g++ cmake git qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtbase-gui qt6-qtdeclarative-devel

# Arch
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake git qt6-base
```

Then build and run:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
bash tools/osmand_render_helper_native/build_linux.sh
osmand-preview --backend auto
```

Direct entry point:

```bash
python src/maps/main.py --backend auto
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install cmake qt git-lfs
git lfs install
git lfs pull
python -m pip install -e .
QT_ROOT=/opt/homebrew/opt/qt JOBS=4 bash tools/osmand_render_helper_native/build_macos.sh
osmand-preview --backend auto
```

Run either backend explicitly:

```bash
python -m maps.main --backend python
python -m maps.main --backend native
```

## 📝 Runtime Notes

- The preview defaults to `src/maps/tiles/World_basemap_2.obf` and the vendored resources under `vendor/osmand/resources`.
- The bundled `.obf` is a Git LFS file; run `git lfs pull` after cloning before expecting visible map content.
- The bundled `.obf` is replaceable, so you can test other OsmAnd map extracts.
- **Windows:** helper outputs in `tools/osmand_render_helper_native/dist` and `tools/osmand_render_helper_native/dist-msvc` are generated and ignored by Git.
- **Linux:** helper outputs in `tools/osmand_render_helper_native/dist-linux` are generated and ignored by Git.
- **macOS:** helper outputs in `tools/osmand_render_helper_native/dist-macosx` are generated and ignored by Git.
- When the native widget runtime is available, the preview can use the embedded OsmAnd widget; otherwise the Python rendering path remains available.
- On Linux, the native widget library is built as a `.so` file; on macOS it is built as `osmand_native_widget.dylib`.
- If you embed the native widget on Linux and hit XCB/GLX issues, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) and the [Python SDK Guide](docs/python-sdk-guide.md) for Qt runtime flags that must be applied before `QApplication` starts.
